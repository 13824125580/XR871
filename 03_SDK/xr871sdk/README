Configuration
-------------

- Edit "gcc.mk" to define GCC path to your own path, eg.
	CC_DIR = ~/tools/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_9-2015q2/bin
	CC_PREFIX = $(CC_DIR)/arm-none-eabi-

- Enable debugging using Keil: set "MDK_DEBUG_ENABLE = 1" in "gcc.mk".


Building
--------

- Libraries
	$ cd src
	$ make				# compile all libraries
	$ make install			# copy all libraries to "lib"
	$ make clean			# remove files generated by `make`

- Projects
	$ cd ${prj_gcc_path}		# eg. cd project/wlan_demo/gcc
	$ make lib			# build libraries and copy them to "lib"
	$ make lib_clean		# remove files in "src" generated by `make lib`
	$ make				# build the executable binary
	$ make install			# copy the executable binary file to bin/
	$ make image			# create the image file
	$ make clean			# remove files generated by `make`
	$ make objdump			# generate the disassembled file
